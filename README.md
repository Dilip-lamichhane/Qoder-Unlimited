<summary><b>⭐ What Makes Us Stand Out</b></summary>

```
🎯 UNIQUE FEATURES:

    • Fix missing workbench.desktop.main.js file

    • Fix Qoder installation location issues
 👥 In-App Account Manager - Multi-account management (Beta, untested)
    • Create, import, switch, and delete accounts

    Automated signups are extremely outdated and unreliable
    All account management is manual and user-controlled
